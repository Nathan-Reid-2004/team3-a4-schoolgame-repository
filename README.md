Repository containing all work &amp; documents related to Assignment 4 for GAME-10003-02. 

In School Game, the player was meant to navigate a replica of the E120 classroom. Players would interact with NPCs and complete small fetch quests, gathering items scattered across the room. 
**Disclaimer: We were unable to complete the game before the due date, however we did manage to implement certain core features and art, such as player movement, collision, dialogue, and various sprites. The hitboxes are still visible in the final build, however they were to be disabled upon implementation of environment sprites.**
